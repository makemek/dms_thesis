\chapter{Literature Review}
This chapter introduces some existing document management system.
Section \ref{dms-features} gives lists of required features of \dms.
Section \ref{relate-works} explores some existing document management applications.

\section{Integrated features} \label{dms-features}
Document management is the process of applying policies and rules to how documents are created, persisted, and expired within an organization.
We analysed each service based on the following features.

\begin{description}
\item[Access Control] \hfill \\
This feature controls how much user can interact with the document.
The system should use role-based access control to authorize the user because IC classify employees by their responsibilities.
A role-based access control defines what operation user can perform based on their roles.

\item[Archiving and Retention] \hfill \\
How the system stores documents on a permanent storage.
How the system search and retrieve files.
This feature manage the files and how to access them.

\item[Collaboration] \hfill \\
This feature enables users to cooperate with other individuals on the same document. 

\item[Document Assembly] \hfill \\
This feature assists user to create a digital document.
It provides the document with pre-existing text called a template when the user creates a new document.

\item[Version Control] \hfill \\
Version control is the management of changes to documents.
It stores changes' history for later recovery.
In this case, the system has to have a periodic document backup when user is editing a document.
Lastly, user should be able to create new revision of document when they ready to publish the document.

\item[Form Management] \hfill \\
This feature let user creates and manages document forms.
The system treats form as another type of document.
The difference is user can fill in the blank fields provided in the document.

\item[Document Searching Service] \hfill \\

User does not have to look within the storage by oneself.
The system provides user with various searching criteria for user to get what they need.
\end{description}

\section{Related Works} \label{relate-works}
We pick 9 existing document management applications to investigate.
Each application has its interesting functionalities and characteristics.
We review them based on 7 characteristic features as stated above.
