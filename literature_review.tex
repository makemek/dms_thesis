\chapter{Literature Review}
This chapter introduces some existing document management system.
Section \ref{dms-features} gives lists of required features of Document Management System for Monkey Office.
Section \ref{relate-works} explores some existing document management applications.

\section{Integrated features} \label{dms-features}
Document management is the process of applying policies and rules to how documents are created, persisted, and expired within an organization.
We analyse each service based on the following features.

\begin{description}
\item[Access Control] \hfill \\
This feature controls how much user can interact with the document.
The system should use role-based access control to authorize the user because \gls{ic} classify employees by their responsibilities.
A role-based access control defines what operation user can perform based on their roles.

\item[Archiving and Retention] \hfill \\
How the system stores documents on a permanent storage.
How the system search and retrieve files.
This feature manage the files and how to access them.

\item[Collaboration] \hfill \\
This feature enables users to cooperate with other individuals on the same document. 


\item[Revision Control] \hfill \\
Revision control is the management of changes to documents.
It stores changes' history for later recovery.
In this case, the system has to have a periodic document backup when user is editing a document.
Lastly, user should be able to create new revision of document when they ready to publish the document.

\item[Form Management] \hfill \\
This feature let user creates and manages document forms.
The system treats form as another type of document.
The difference is user can fill in the blank fields provided in the document.

\item[Document Searching Service] \hfill \\
When user request a document, the system will look in its storage based on given keywords.
User does not have to look within the storage by oneself.
The system provides user with various searching criteria for user to get what they need.
\end{description}

\section{Related Works} \label{relate-works}
We pick nine popular existing document management applications with related to our project requirements to investigate.
Each application has its interesting functionalities and characteristics.
and review them based on seven characteristic features as stated above.

\begin{description}
\item[Alfresco One] \hfill \\
Alfresco One allows organizations to manage any type of content from small office documents, photographs, to large video files.
The system allows users to choose how to access their content --- via the Web, desktop or email --- while the server enforces access controls and security.

\item[eFileCabinet] \hfill \\
eFileCabinet hosts documents on their cloud server.
It searches document by filename and tags.
The program saves search history every time user perform a search for auto completion.
It can look for word and phrases inside a document.
User can sends document directly to eFileCabinet from Windows File Explorer or Microsoft Office Products (Add-ons).

\end{figure}

\item[Contentverse] \hfill \\
Contentverse has file naming and storing similar to cabinet and folder structure, indexed for immediate full-text search and retrieval.
The program track every changes -- every version of any file available for reference.
