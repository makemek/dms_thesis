\chapter{Methodology}
\section{Introduction}
The overall purposes of this study is to improve efficiencies of \gls{ic}'s digital document management strategies. 
The study involves investigating internal \gls{ic}'s working procedures and regulations.
How \gls{ic} execute strategies on their digital document assets.
What are advantages and disadvantages of their strategies.
Gaining such information is valuable to this study because plausible solutions could be proposed and implemented. 
Solutions that could further improve flows of documents inside \gls{ic}.
This chapter presents reasonable research methods to address the research questions.
Conceptual design will also be introduced to provide an abstract model of this experiment.

\section{Research Strategy}
Section \ref{sec:motivation} introduced digital document problems occurred inside \gls{ic}.
These problems were formulated to research questions suitable for this study.
The study's goal is to create a system to verify the hypotheses posed by four research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the critical factors contribute to extreme delay in searching and retrieving documents even though IC have already organized them?
	\item How to store and retrieve digital \gls{ic}'s documents so that authorized users can access within \gls{ic}, \gls{kmitl} precinct?
	\item How to track \gls{ic}'s document going through each task specified by \gls{ic}'s document workflow?
	\item How to model \gls{ic}'s workflows so that it can be executed automatically by a computer?
\end{enumerate}
This study implements qualitative research method with three research strategies: interview, case study, and software architectural model.
The following sections discuss these three strategies in more detail.

\subsection{Qualitative Research}
Qualitative research is a systematic process of inquiring or investigating to inform and to decide a course of action \cite{merriam2015qualitative}.
Its main purpose is to establish a basis for decision making, \enquote{to make judgement about the program, improve program effectiveness, and/or inform decisions about future programming} \cite{patton2005qualitative}.
