\section{Introduction}
The similarities between \gls{dms} and file server is to provide a shared storage of computer files that can be accessed by other computers.
\gls{dms} aims to provide archive documents digitally with access controls while file server aims to store and retrieve files.
The differences between \gls{dms} and file servers are file to file relationship and predetermined workflow.
A file to file relationship is a built-in \gls{dms} feature that shows additional documents inside an organization.
Standalone organization's documents are rare.
Usually, they relate to other documents.
For example, a fire insurance contract refers to property insurance contract and fire policy.
Predetermined workflow is an already created workflow assigned to one or multiple documents.
\gls{dms} automatically assigns access rights to documents based on current workflow's task.
One of these two features suppose to have in order to be \gls{dms}.
Some \gls{dms} provide additional features such as version control or document assembly (Table \ref{tbl:feature-sum}) to satisfy organization's requirements.
