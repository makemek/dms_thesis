\section{Introduction}
The overall purpose of this study is to improve efficiencies of \gls{ic}'s digital document management strategies. 
The study involves investigating internal \gls{ic}'s working procedures and regulations.
How \gls{ic} execute strategies on their digital document assets.
What are their advantages and disadvantages.
Gaining such information is valuable to this study because plausible solutions could be proposed and implemented. 
Solutions that could further improve flows of documents within \gls{ic}.
This chapter presents reasonable research methods to address the research questions.
Conceptual design will also be introduced to provide an abstract model of this experiment.
